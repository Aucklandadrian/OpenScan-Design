# OpenScan - 3D Scanner Designs

Here you can find, discuss and improve the existing 3d scanner designs (and current developments). The inital version was created in SketchUp and we plan on re-creating the OpenScanners in proper CAD software. If you are able to "translate" the designs into some other, more accessible format, you can also share it here.

## User Mods for OpenScan Scanners and How to contribute Designs and provide  Mods

You can actively helping with designing the OpenScan Scanners and provide user mods for others. We have seen many design tweaks and changes from various users on Thingiverse and other platforms. Unfortunately, the user mods on other platforms are slowly getting lost or are not up-to-date. Here, we want to provide a platform for you to exchange your user mods and also provide the option to curate mods so they are not getting lost in time and space. 
If you are familiar to github, then you probably already know how to contribute in projects. In case you are new to github, the way would be to create an account, create your own fork of the project (fork = personal copy you can edit), then you can add (and/or change) user mods (user mods have a dedicated folder). Finally, you can create a pull request of your changes and user mods to the official OpenScan Project. After checking and approving your report and pull request, your user mods will be listed in the official github page. 
If you are unsure about the whole process or simple want to share a single STL with the community, you can also ask for help on our discord channel. The curators of the github project can help you there.
