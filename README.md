# OpenScan - 3D Scanner Designs

Here you can find, discuss and improve the existing 3d scanner designs (and current developments). I need your help! My design capabilities are very limited and I only used SketchUp, which is very limited. It would be great if you are able to "translate" the designs into some other, more accessible format.
