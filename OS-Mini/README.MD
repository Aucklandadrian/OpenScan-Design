# OS Mini

The mini is the typical al-in-one version for smaller objects up to 8-9cm in diameter. The V1 is the current official version and all shipped kits are packaged for the V1. 
The V2 is in development and also comes with an updated shield. Nonetheless, the V1 shield will also work with the V2. However, the hardware parts, such as screws, have to be sourced on your own.

## Print settings
Generally, 3-4 walls, 5-6 top and bottom layers, 30-40% infill cuboid/gyroid/hex/grid, 0.2mm layer height
While it is okay to use PLA, when having multiple long scanning sessions in warm environments, PLA can slowly deform under the warmth and weight of the motors and drivers. 
Thus, it is recommended to use PETG or ABS/ASA (if your printer can reliably print those).

## Built-in bridging help

The V2 has included bridging helpers so your printer always takes the shortest bridging path when printing the rotor housing. The remedies the issue with many slicers when printing long but narrow overhang bridges of curved surfaces.No more screwed up bridges
